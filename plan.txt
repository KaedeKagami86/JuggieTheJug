General Logistic:
if button_on() is True:
    start main program
else (like if button is off):
    stop main program

Main program:
display_time()
if time_elapsed() >= 5sec (or some arbitrary time): (run always)
    if force_sensed() is False: (run always)
        chase_target()
            if difference() <= 10cm:
                spray_water()
    else:
        reset_time()
        (just time = 0, and this should restart the whole program)
else:
    do nothing

Input:
    ultrasonic sensor
    force sensor
    button (press sensor I guess)
    time elapsed(?)

Output:
    motor1&2
    motor for spraying water
    show count down time

Main functions:
            display_time(): get time elapsed, get the time interval you want,
                            number = subtract to get the time displayed,
                            display this number
            chase_target()
            spray_water()

Set up functions: set_up_all_pin_numbers(doesn't need to be a helper function),
                  set_up_buttons(both), set_up_timer(), set_up_OLED(), set_up_moving_motor1(),
                  set_up_moving_motor2(), set_up_spray_water_motor(),
                  set_up_ultrasonic_sensor(), set_up_force_sensor()
                  (or just write one huge function to set up everything if that's easier)


Helper functions for getting state of input:
            button_on(on_button_state: HIGH/LOW, off_button_state: HIGH/LOW) -> Bool,
            time_elapsed(current_time: unsigned long, start_time: unsigned long) -> unsigned long,
            force_sensed(force: int) -> Bool,
            current_distance() -> long

Other helper functions:
            difference(current_distance: int, expected: int) -> int,
            reset_time() -> None
