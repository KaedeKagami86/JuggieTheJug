## Inspiration
One of us always forgets to drink water and only realizes we are dehydrated after getting headaches and other effects. We realized this is a common thing that happens to many people, especially nowadays since most people drink beverages instead of water. We wished there was a water jug that chases you down if you forgot to drink water- so we decided to make it!

## What it does
It is a water jug that chases you down and sprays water at you if you forget to drink water after the time interval you decide is up.

## How we built it
We used 3d modeling to print out the water jug's body and designed it through Fusion. We used Arduino to code it and control the different parts connected to the Arduino board. We used bread board to connect everything, ultrasonic sensor to sense the distance between the target and the jug, force sensor to sense if the water jug is picked up and used, motors and wheels to move it, another motor to spray water, and an OLED to display time.

## Challenges we ran into
A motor we had was of wrong type so we had to run around to find a right one. We originally wanted to use ESP32, but it didn't work, so we changed to Arduino. 3d modelling parts were not out yet, so we decided to use cardboard and paper cup instead.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The prototype can actually "chase" target, though only in straight line for now, count down time correctly, and spray water!

## What we learned
We learned how to use Arduino better, how to connect sensors, and how to code in Arduino better

## What's next for JuggieTheJug
We can 3d print the body.
